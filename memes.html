			<p>The memes below play on various themes taken up by <span class="italic">Fieldwork of Empire</span>. In theory, the sequence consists of fifteen memes, but only eight are published here. Items missing from the sequence serve to alert viewers to gaps in the documentary record. Such gaps might be read as corresponding to the non-western voices that have been erased from the history of the British Empire in Africa.<p>
